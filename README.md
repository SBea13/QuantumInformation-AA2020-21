# QuantumInformation-AA2020-21
Weekly assignements for prof. Montangero's course Quantum Information and Computing @UniPD

Each folder includes the final $\LaTeX$ report, the main `Fortran` code and usually a Jupyter notebook with a `Python` helper script.
Plots are usally produced with `gnuplot` for the first reports, then with `matplotlib` for the final ones (from ex07).

Hope thay can be helpful to someone :)
