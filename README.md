# QuantumInformation-AA2020-21
Weekly assignments for prof. Montangero's course Quantum Information and Computing @UniPD

Each folder includes the text of the exercise, the main `Fortran` code, the final LaTeX report and usually a Jupyter notebook with a `Python` helper script. 
Plots are usally produced with `gnuplot` for the first reports, then with `matplotlib` for the final ones (from ex07).

Hope thay can be helpful to someone :)
